# UNetHypo
This repository contains python code to train a U-Net, a convolutional neural network based deep learning model, to reconstruct a 2D seimsic input into a 3D output. The seismic input is meant to contain an earthquake recorded at multiple seismic stations. The model learns to reconstruct a 3D output representing a Gaussian distribution with the peak at the source location. The training data contains both the seimsic input and the hypocenter location, i.e. the coordinates of the earthquake. During training these coordinates are used to create the target output (the 3D Gaussian distribution).
